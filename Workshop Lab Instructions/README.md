# Lab Instructions
These lab instructions complement the presentation and provide hands-on experience in a few areas of focus:

- Linux Namespaces
-- Mount Namespace
-- PID Namespace
-- Network Namespace

- CGroups
-- Resource Isolation with CGroups V1

- seccomp-bpf
-- Kernel 'syscall firewall'

There are other namespaces and additional isolation and control mechanisms that Linux makes available. These are a good place to start when considering what is needed to start building a 'containerized' system.
